Our first HSJ article described deaths in UK healthcare workers from Covid-19. This was one of the first papers to describe the link between ethnicity and increased risk of dying from Covid-19. We used media reports of health and social care worker deaths to identify risks, and included 106 cases. 63% of individuals were of BAME / minority ethnic background, and many were born outside the UK. We noted lower rates in those working in (perceived) higher risk environments such as ICU and anaesthesia.
